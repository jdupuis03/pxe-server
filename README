PXE daemon readme
=================

This is an implementation of the Intel PXE bootstrap protocol. This protocol
is roughtly speaking based upon the bootp protocol, and currently needs the
bootp daemon to work.

The bootp daemon can be found on any sunsite.unc mirror, under
/pub/Linux/system/network/boot.net/bootpd-2.4.tar.gz

To obtain a bootstrap (code that prepares the machine for a kernel) please 
look at: http://syslinux.zytor.com/pxe.php
