PXE daemon readme
=================

This is an implementation of the Intel PXE bootstrap protocol. This protocol is roughtly speaking based upon the bootp protocol, and currently needs the bootp daemon to work.

The bootp daemon can be found on any sunsite.unc mirror, under
/pub/Linux/system/network/boot.net/bootpd-2.4.tar.gz

It is also recommended that you obtain the Intel/Redhat PXE package. This is because it contains a bootstrap program that interacts with the PXE ROM on the client, and loads the kernel. I don't have enough x86 hardware knowedge to make on of these. However, <plead> if anyone feels up to the task, feel free to contact me </plead>. There is a PXE ROM API spec to make life a little easier.

The Intel/Redhat PXE package can be found at
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/current/SRPMS/i386/SRPMS/pxe-0.1-20.src.rpm
However this will *only* work on X86 Linux machines.

To install the PXE daemon , please follow the directions in the INSTALL file.
